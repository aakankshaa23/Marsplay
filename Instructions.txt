Hello,
This is Aakanksha Tewari, a 3rd year undergraduate interested in programming and development.

This include the entire work starting from retrofit and gson parsing to setting them in recyclerview.

Material guidelines were followed to make the product unique.
Animations were used to expand/collapse views.

UI Test case--
1. Clicking the card would expand and clicking again on top will collapse.
2. clicking the card would expand and clicking on abstract will expand the whole text.
3. after expanding the whole text, clicking on top will collapse the whole card.
4. afterwards clicking the card would show the latest changes i.e. the whole card.
5. If internet is not available, then Toast will come.


Jetpacks used-
1.Recycler View
2.Card View
3.OkHttp for increasing timeout
4.Retrofit
